In this site we will host a collection of "proceedings" for the **Paperinick** initiative, hosted by a group of PhD students at the department of Statistical Sciences in the University of Padova.

The project consists in regular half-an-hour weekly meetings (with some margin to double up during the week, if necessary) during which we discuss some research topic that some of us has encountered.
