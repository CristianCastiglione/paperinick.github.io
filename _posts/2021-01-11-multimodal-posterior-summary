## Multimodal posterior distributions

In this discussion we deal with two cases that generates multimodal distributions
- Large discrete parameter spaces: not ordered. (Ex: partition spaces in clustering).

- Non-identifiability/symmetry in the parameter space: label switching, sign switching ... (Ex: mixture parameters, loadings matrix in factor analysis...)

Problem in well done MCMC: we obtain $S$ samples that are drawn from the more than one modes of the posterior distribution.

\begin{frame}{Why usual summaries does not work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 	MCMC mean: usually it is not meaningful!
	\item 	MCMC mode: not feasible (large or infinite parameter space)
	\item 	MCMC median: ordering?
\end{itemize}

**Why usual summaries does not work?**
- MCMC mean: not meaningful! Let's think to the mean between two modes... 

-	MCMC mode: not feasible! The parameter space is infinite (or very very large) so that the points are visited only once by the chain.

- MCMC median: ordering?

Let's look in details the most common cases where summaries of multimodal posterior are desired.

## Bayesian clustering
  #### Notation: $S$ samples, $k$ possible groups, observation $n$ belongs to group $g_n$.	
  
	Let's start with the  simpler case!
  
	Why is simpler?
  - We can reduce the parameter space to the partition space: absence of symmetry (usually...).
